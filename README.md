## Animate!

Animate the web! Because it's a bit of fun.

Available as a browser extension for [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/animate-the-web/) and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/animate/kkmbdnidlbkkhhdgchkagbdicfbfjahe).

Choose your selector/animation/options and click Animate! Select specific elements using the mouse, or use CSS selectors. Apply predefined animations or construct your own using CSS properties. Choose animation options such as duration, timing, and direction. You can add multiple animations, undo, and reset.

You can use it just for fun, or as a tool for web development. Or both!

This project is built using the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) using JavaScript ES6. It is natively compatible with Mozilla Firefox and has been made compatible with Google Chrome using Mozilla's [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill). It uses the wonderful [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) library of Daniel Eden.
